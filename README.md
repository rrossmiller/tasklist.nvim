# This needs a better name
A floating window plugin for easy access to todos and other notes

- [x] read and write todos in buffer from/to a file
- [ ] project/repo-level vs global todo 
- [ ] fancy icons
    - change a prefix of a line to mean that the todo is done and the style of the line should change to reflect that
